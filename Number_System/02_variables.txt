Variables are the name of memory location that can store data.

Scope ke according hum Variables ko 3 types m divide kar saktey hai:- 
1)Local Variables: Jinki life kewal methods takk hoti hai.
2)Instance Variables: Jinki life complete class m hoti hai.
3)Static Variables: 


*)Local Variables:- 
Declairation- Inside Block, method or constructor
Scope- Inside Block, method or constructor
When Variables gets allocated- When Block, method or constructor called
Stored memory- stack memory
Default value- None
Access Specifier- can not be used
How to access- Within Block, method or constructor

*)Instance Variables:- 
Declairation- Inside class Outside Block, method or constructor
Scope- within class
When Variables gets allocated- when object is created
Stored memory- Heap Memory
Default value- Default value hoti hai
Access Specifier- can be used
How to access- Directly, making instance of class

*)Static Variables:- 
Declairation- within class but using static keyword.
Scope- similar to instance Variables
When Variables gets allocated- when we run program or .class file loaded
Stored memory- non-heap memory/static memory
Default value- similar to instance Variables
Access Specifier- can be used
How to access- Within Block, method or constructor, by method.Variable
